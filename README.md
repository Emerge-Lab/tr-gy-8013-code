# tr-gy-8013-code
Code examples and homeworks for the Spring 2024 tr-gy course

# Installation
Make sure you have a base version of python installed on your machine. I recommend using mamba or conda for this. We are going to use poetry to manage dependencies for this course. You can install it using pip `pip install poetry`. Then, run 
```
poetry install
```
Now to active poetry always run `poetry shell` before running any of the commands.
